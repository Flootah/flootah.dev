        Eduardo Saenz<br>
        most people call me Ed, or floot<br>
        <br>
        twenty-five, toiled, and mired.<br>
        a tired cadance and rarely inspired.<br>
        thinly covered in patience and dust.<br>
        plugged into software that isn't robust.<br>
        <br>
        i write code so that i can live and play games and<br> listen to music and maybe write more code.<br>
        i think art is a very special thing; illustrations, games, music, all of them.<br>
        i hope i can create something special, someday.<br>
