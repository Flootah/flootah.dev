        <p style="text-align: center;">
surrounded by thorns to keep out the weeds.
whispers in a garden, someone's pleads.
i reach to harrowed flowers gazing at me
they see me bleeding. they say: "let's see"

my eyes open and scorn as the embers wave back
they told me the garden needs something i lack
so quickly the blow made me with i never cared
such foolish thoughts that destroyed the foal
touched feelings that told me i'd never be whole
so sick when i knew i may never get there</p>
