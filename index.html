        hello!! and welcome. to my internet space.<br>
        <br>
        i've built a little place here, to put all of my things.<br>
        things i've made and things i've thought and things.. like that.<br>
        i hope you enjoy browsing around.<br>

        ah.. it's been a while.. again..<br>
        i'm back, mostly just to dust off the cobwebs and make the writing around here more current.
        tick up my age in the about section, edit the bio a bit.. little things.<br>
        i also need to update the poetry list.. it deserves a full header section, methinks<br>
        for next time. i'll definitely update sooner than 18 months from now, though. (maybe.)<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        1.16.2023<br>
        new things:<br>
        * more poetry, find it at the top of the list.<br>
        * new recs! now reflecting my new-er tastes.<br>
        ** recs also now all have links, so you can find what i'm talking about
